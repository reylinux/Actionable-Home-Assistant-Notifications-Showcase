# Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase
I've been exploring [actionable notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/actionable-notifications/) in Home Assistant‚Äîand I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with how much control and convenience they add to my smart home setup. With a bit of help from AI (since I'm not a coder), I was able to build a series of automations that not only alert me to important events but also let me take immediate action, all from the notification itself. I‚Äôll just include the action part of the YAML, not the whole automation, to keep it clear and to the point.

Here's a breakdown of what I‚Äôve built so far:

**üå°Ô∏è [Climate Control Notifications](https://github.com/reylinux/Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase/blob/main/Climate.txt)**

When a room‚Äôs temperature goes beyond a comfortable threshold‚Äîeither too hot or too cold‚ÄîI get a notification with a button that lets me instantly trigger the cooling or heating system. It‚Äôs a quick way to react to uncomfortable indoor conditions without opening the Home Assistant app.

Example:

**üåã [Volcanic, Earthquake & Severe Weather Alerts](https://github.com/reylinux/Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase/blob/main/Weather.txt)**

This one‚Äôs been a fun and incredibly useful challenge. Using automation triggers from various sensors and integrations, I now receive alerts for:

- Nearby earthquakes
- Volcanic activity
- Severe weather warnings

Each alert includes an action button that takes me directly to a pop-up card or a full page with detailed information, visuals, and links to official sources.

Example:

**üí°Lighting Control **
Sometimes household members still use traditional wall switches, which can mess with the Hue smart lighting system. These notifications let me quickly:

- [Turn lights back on](https://github.com/reylinux/Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase/blob/main/Switch%20Fall%20Out.txt) if they‚Äôve been cut off from power
- [Turn off all lights](https://github.com/reylinux/Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase/blob/main/Light%20Off.txt) when nobody is home

It‚Äôs a simple but effective way to keep lighting consistent and efficient.

Example:

**üõ°Ô∏è [Alarm System Actions](https://github.com/reylinux/Actionable-Home-Assistant-Notifications-Showcase/blob/main/Alarm.txt)**
When the alarm is triggered‚Äîor if we forget to arm it‚ÄîI get a prompt with an action button that takes me straight to the alarm panel. No need to navigate through the homepage or dashboard‚Äîit‚Äôs all about speed and responsiveness.

Example:
